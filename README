PiTftDpms: A utility for the Adafruit PiTft 3.5" resistive touchscreen

Dependencies:
You will need to install the "libXext-dev" package so that the required
headers will be available when compiling the source, and of course you will
also need a C compiler. In all likelihood, your system probably already has
gcc on it.

For example: "sudo apt install libXext-dev"

To build the executable, run the following command line in this directory:
gcc PiTftDpms.c -lX11 -lXext -o PiTftDpms

This should produce the PiTftDpms executable in this directory.

To run it from the command line to test it out, use the following command:
"sudo DISPLAY=:0.0 ./PiTftDpms &"
This will launch the tool as a background process and return to the
command line.  What you should see is that when the X Windows screensaver
kicks in, the utility will notice the change in state and will shut off
the PiTft backlight at the same time.  By the same token, if you then touch
the screen to wake it back up, the backlight will be turned back on.
That's it!

Limitations:
- The utility only knows how to listen the the X Windows DPMS extension
  for display power management.  If X Windows isn't running, or the X Windows
  screen saver function is disabled, then the utility will exit when you 
  launch it, or will simply do nothing.  If you are using the PiTft with some
  other kind of application (e.g. omxplayer), no backlight control will
  take place.
- Launching the utility automatically at system startup, via systemd, or
  through the Octoprint TouchUI startup scripts, is left as an exercise for
  the reader (for now.)
